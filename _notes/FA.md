title: "A note of Fourier Analysis"
pdf_url: "/notes/FA.pdf"
---

The note is based on Chapter 2,3,5,6 of Stein's book Fourier Analysis: An Introduction, which is 
an elegant book for undergraduates majoring in mathematics, especially the beginners with 
basic knowledge of Mathematical Analysis. I read the book after my first year of math learning and it 
really invoked my interest of further analysis, because you can easily find its applications in solving 
wave equations and heat equations by just using Fourier transformation on those equations, what a useful tool!
