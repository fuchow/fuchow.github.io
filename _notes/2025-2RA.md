title: "A note of Real Analysis"

The note is based on some chapters of both Stein's book **Real Analysis** and Folland's book **Real Analysis**. Both 
are classical textbook for learners of this discipline. In my opinion, Stein's book are much more friendly for beginer, 
but if someone wants to get a broader understanding of real analysis, I personally think it will be a better choice to 
read Folland's book after reading the first three chapters of Stein's book.
