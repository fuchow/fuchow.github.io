The note is my padnote of **Complex Analysis**, written for recording what I have learnt. As for the textbook, I mainly referred to the 
first seven chapters of **复变函数** written by 史济怀&刘太顺 and the fourth and fifth chapters of **Complex analysis** written by Stein. 
The theory, mainly about the holomorphic functions, manifest an interesting world of analysis different from what I had learnt. Maybe I can 
have a deeper understanding after learning Riemann Surface.
